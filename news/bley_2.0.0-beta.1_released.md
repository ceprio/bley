After only three years, I have finally released bley 2.0.0-beta.1, the first milestone to bley 2.0.0. Yes, this is a huge version jump, mostly because the 0.1.x series was more like a 1.0 series and [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) suggests do increase the major digit when doing incompatible changes (updated DB layout, new command line switches, etc). Please test this and report if you find any issues.
