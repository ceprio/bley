Uploading to ftp-master (via ftp to ftp.upload.debian.org):<br/> 
  Uploading bley_0.1.1-1.dsc: done.<br/> 
  Uploading bley_0.1.1.orig.tar.gz: done.<br/> 
  Uploading bley_0.1.1-1.debian.tar.gz: done.<br/> 
  Uploading bley_0.1.1-1_all.deb: done.<br/> 
  Uploading bley_0.1.1-1_amd64.changes: done.<br/> 
This means: bley was just uploaded to Debian. It's currently in the <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html">NEW queue</a>, but I hope it will hit the archive very soon :)<br/> 
I'll post the .deb under <a href="download.html">download</a> in a couple of minutes.
