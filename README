DEPENDENCIES:
 twisted-core from http://twistedmatrix.com/
 twisted-names from http://twistedmatrix.com/
 pyspf from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyspf
 psycopg2 from http://initd.org/

INSTALLATION:
 Quick and dirty:
  Unpack the tarball, adjust bley.conf and run bley (NOT bley.py!).

 Still quick, but not dirty:
  Unpack the tarball, python setup.py build, python setup.py install,
  adjust /etc/bley.conf, run /usr/bin/bley

CONFIGURATION:
 Basically you just have to set 'database' and 'dsn' so bley can talk to
 the database. 'database' is a DB-API 2.0 [1] compliant Python module,
 like 'psycopg2' or 'MySQLdb' (psycopg2 is the only one we tested though).
 
 After that you can point your Postfix to bley as a policy server by
 adding 'check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:1337' to your
 'smtpd_recipient_restrictions' in main.cf.
 
 bley will be working now, but you probably would like to tune it more
 for your needs (esp. the used DNWLs and DNSBLs, the greylisting times
 and the hit thresholds)
