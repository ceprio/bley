ABOUT:
 bley is an intelligent greylisting daemon for Postfix.
 It uses various test (incl. RBL and SPF) to decide whether a sender
 should be grylisted or not, thus mostly eliminating the usual greylisting
 delay while still filtering most of the spam.

DEPENDENCIES:
 twisted-core from http://twistedmatrix.com/
 pyspf from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyspf
 psycopg2 from http://initd.org/psycopg/

INSTALLATION:
 Quick and dirty:
  Unpack the tarball, adjust bley.conf and run bley (NOT bley.py!).

 Still quick, but not dirty:
  Unpack the tarball, python setup.py build, python setup.py install,
  adjust /etc/bley/bley.conf  (see CONFIGURATION below), run /usr/bin/bley

CONFIGURATION:
 Basically you just have to set 'dbtype' and the various 'db*' settings
 so bley can talk to the database. 'database' is either 'pgsql' for
 PostgreSQL, 'mysql' for MySQL or 'sqlite3' for SQLite3.
 The other db settings are:
 'dbhost' - the host where the database runs on (usually localhost)
 'dbname' - the name (or path in case of SQLite) of the database (usually bley)
 'dbuser' - the name of the database user
 'dbpass' - the password of the database user
 
 After that you can point your Postfix to bley as a policy server by
 adding 'check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:1337' to your
 'smtpd_recipient_restrictions' in main.cf.
 
 bley will be working now, but you probably would like to tune it more
 for your needs (esp. the used DNWLs and DNSBLs, the greylisting times
 and the hit thresholds)
